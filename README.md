# How to install Visual Studio with Visual Micro

1. If you do not have VS Community or Professional (NOT EXPRESS), install [Visual Studio Community Edition](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-community-vs.aspx)
2. While downloading VS, you can download and install the newest stable release of the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software)
3. Run the Arduino IDE at least once.
4. Install VS Community Edition.  Reboot if needed.
5. Start VS Community Edition at least once.
6. Download the Latest version of the [Visual Micro Plugin](http://www.visualmicro.com/page/Arduino-Visual-Studio-Downloads.aspx)
7. Install the Visual Micro plugin
8. Start Visual studio.
9. Visual Micro will ask you to point it to your Arduino IDE.  Do so now.


You should now be able to create Sketch Projects, open .ino files in Visual Studio, and open the "rLoop-Test" .sln file which contains the CAN Bus test programs in this repository.
